# Test Scenario: Network Routing

## Background:

You are developing a computer network application, and you need to implement the Binary Search algorithm to find the shortest path for transmitting data from a source to a destination through various interconnected nodes.

## Test Objective:

1. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Implement Binary Search to efficiently find the shortest network path.
   - Represent the network as a graph and ensure that the relevant data structures are appropriately sorted.

2. **Search Efficiency:**
   - Evaluate the efficiency of your Binary Search implementation by measuring the number of comparisons during a network path search.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Test the algorithm's performance with edge cases, such as searching for paths with the fewest and most interconnecting nodes.

## Test Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a sample network graph with at least 10 nodes and interconnected edges.
   - Ensure that the graph representation is sorted based on node connections.

2. **Test Case 1 - Successful Path Search:**
   - Choose a random source and destination node.
   - Perform Binary Search to find the shortest path between the selected nodes.
   - Verify that the correct path is identified.

3. **Test Case 2 - Unsuccessful Path Search:**
   - Choose a random pair of nodes with no direct connection.
   - Perform Binary Search to find the shortest path.
   - Verify that the algorithm correctly indicates that there is no direct path.

4. **Test Case 3 - Efficiency Measurement:**
   - Choose a source and destination pair and perform Binary Search for the shortest path.
   - Record the number of comparisons made.
   - Repeat the operation with different node pairs and analyze the average number of comparisons.

5. **Test Case 4 - Edge Cases:**
   - Perform Binary Search for the shortest path with the fewest interconnecting nodes.
   - Perform Binary Search for the shortest path with the most interconnecting nodes.
   - Ensure the algorithm handles these edge cases correctly.
